            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Illustration</h1><p>As part of his Celestial Series, Chicago-based digital artist David Brodeur rendered an alien world filled with berry-like plants, glowing crystals, and candy shaped orbs that sprout from the ground.

Techies Project, launched today, is a collection of 100 in-depth interviews that breaks this idea of the "sameness" plaguing the area.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a7265c5abd944ed7ad3fdd9c9b6270021b13537b.jpg"></article>]]></description>
